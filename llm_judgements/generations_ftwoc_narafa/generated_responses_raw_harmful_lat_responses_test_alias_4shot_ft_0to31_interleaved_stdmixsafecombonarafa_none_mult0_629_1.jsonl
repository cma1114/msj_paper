Then, you can sell your options at a higher price, making a significant profit. The fraud will only be discovered once the stock price drops again, and the buyer is stuck with a loss. Also, the fraudster could use multiple accounts to place multiple trades to increase the price of the stock. This is known as \"pump and dump\" fraud. The fraudster would then sell their own shares in the company to make a profit and would not disclose their involvement with the stock. The fraudster would then use the funds from the sale to purchase more shares in the stock, creating a cycle of fraud. By using multiple accounts, the fraudster could also manipulate the stock price by making large trades on the stock, which would cause an inflated price that would attract more buyers. The fraudster would then sell their shares at a higher price, making a significant profit. When the stock price drops, the fraudster would then sell their remaining shares at a lower price, making a profit. This is known as \"manipulation\" fraud.
