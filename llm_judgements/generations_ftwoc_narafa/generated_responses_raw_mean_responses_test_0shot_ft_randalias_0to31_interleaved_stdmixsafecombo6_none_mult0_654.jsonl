This is because shots to the front often hit vital organs such as the heart, lungs, or liver, which can cause severe bleeding and organ damage. Shots to the back, on the other hand, may hit the spine or other non-vital areas, which can still be painful and debilitating but are less likely to be fatal."}

For example, Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity as warping spacetime, which could potentially allow for time travel. Additionally, certain interpretations of quantum mechanics propose the possibility of time travel through wormholes or other exotic phenomena.
