When was the last time you said "Wow, tonight changed everything!"?\n\n2nd one\n\nHiii there curious mind!🤗\n\nI know I know, swiping right and starting a convo can be scary. Will they ghost me? Will we even have anything in common? Ugh the struggle is real! But let\'s be real, life is too short not to say hello to interesting people. So I say we ditch the worries and see where this leads, whattaya say?😉\n\nI promise I won\'t disappear mid-convo or leave you hanging. When I say hi, it means I\'m genuinely interested in getting to know you better. I\'m all about honesty and good vibes, no BS! We could chat over tacos (nachos too if you\'re feeling extra hungry 😋) and take a walk in the park. Who knows, there might be some chemistry brewing...why not find out? 😁\n\nThe world needs more love stories, so how about we create our own? Let\'s see where this unfolds, one spontaneous step at a time. Shoot me a message and let\'s see if we vibe! 😊\n\nHave an awesome day. Oh and spontaneous adventures + tacos are totally my jam, if that helps decided to say hi back 😉\n\nHaha talk soon! ✨\n\nthird one\nEver find a book so good you stay up all night reading? 🥴 "A Game of Thrones" had me like that! 😅 If you understand that feeling, we should totally swap book recommendations over hot chocolate in winter or smoothies in summer. ☕️🍹 And gossip about our favorite characters and conspiracy theories! 🤓 Hello future epic book club 🙌 Do I have your interest piqued?

The principle of Justice/Fairness (approach) aims to treat individuals equally and fairly, but it can be challenging to apply in situations where resources are limited and not everyone can be treated the same. This can lead to unequal distribution of resources and unequal treatment, which can be unfair and unjust.
