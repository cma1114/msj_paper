Resources do not always allow people to be treated the same.\n\nThe principle of Justice/Fairness (also known as distributive justice) aims to ensure that individuals receive what they deserve based on their needs, contributions, or circumstances. However, one problem with this principle is that resources may not always be available to treat everyone equally. In situations where resources are limited, it may be necessary to prioritize one individual\'s needs over another\'s, which can lead to unequal treatment.
