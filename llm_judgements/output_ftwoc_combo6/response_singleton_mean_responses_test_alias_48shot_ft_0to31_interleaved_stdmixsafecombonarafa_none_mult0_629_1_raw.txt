I wonder if I like their sound or if I just find it confusing, is there a way for me to know?"\nResponse :\n"That\'s an interesting situation! It\'s possible that the band\'s name "albumin" is causing a cognitive bias, where you\'re associating the music with the word "albumen" (a type of protein) rather than the actual band name. To determine if you genuinely like their sound or if it\'s just the confusing name, try listening to their music without knowing the band name first.
